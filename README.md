# ChessGame
A 2-player Python chess game

Hello! This is a python program that allows two users to play a chess game together. It has validation to make sure that neither person cheats! It also stops the game when there is a stalemate or checkmate.

If you are interested in seeing previous versions of my game, they are tagged by v<version_name> starting with v0.

This is currently a work in progress, and might have bugs. 

Enjoy and thanks for visiting!
